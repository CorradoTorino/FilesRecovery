# FilesRecovery
A dummy python script to copy files. Nothing more than a TDD and python practice.

I created this project when one of my SDs was damaged and it was impossible to copy files from it. 
I took advantage of this occasion to practice with python and TDD.

Essentialy, the program recursively copy an entire directory tree and in case of error, trace the error and continue. The same result can be easily achieved with shutil.copytree and a proper error handling.
However, it fullfilled the scope of recovering my family pictures and having fun :)
